This project aims to develop a prediction model to assess a patient’s risk of developing diabetes based on specific health metrics. Using variables like age, blood pressure, pulse rate, and blood sugar levels, the model aims to support healthcare providers in delivering targeted interventions. This model will lay the foundation for a telemedicine platform focused on early chronic illness detection; particularly aiding underserved communities where early interventions can significantly enhance care accessibility. The model aligns with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, and SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, by emphasizing equitable access to preventive healthcare through innovative technology.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7iFbmbW_gbYu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Business Questions**\n","\n","- Can we

Random Forest Classifier**\n","\n","- The model has a high overall accuracy (99.39%) and excellent performance across all classes.\n","-  It has high precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class, especially for the underrepresented class (2: Medium Risk).\n","- This suggests that the Random Forest Classifier handles imbalanced classes better after SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which balanced the data before training.\n","\n","**2. Logistic Regression**\n","\n","- Despite the high accuracy (93.86%), the model's performance for class 2 is notably lower than Random Forest.\n","- Precision for class 2 is low, meaning it has difficulty distinguishing this minority class from the others.\n","- However, recall for class 2 is high, indicating that Logistic Regression can find most instances of this class, though it misclassifies some other classes as class 2. This could be due to the linear nature of the model that makes it harder for it to separate minority classes accurately even after applying SMOTE.\n","\n","**3. XGBoost Classifier**\n","- This model has a 99.46% accuracy coupled with high precision, recall and F1-scores.\n","- It performs well in predicting low-risk and high-risk categories but less strongly on medium-risk prediction with slightly lower precision (91%), recall (91%) and F1-scores (91%).\n","\n","**4. Gradient Boosting Classifier**\n","- At 99.26% accuracy, the weakness in predicting medium-risk class is still prevalent.\n","- Precision, recall and F1-scores for medium-risk class are 85%, 95% and 90% respectively.\n","\n","Overall, **XGBoost** performed the best at 99.46% accuracy.
